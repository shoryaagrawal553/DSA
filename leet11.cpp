/*ðŸ§  Logic Summary:
You're using the two-pointer technique because brute force (O(nÂ²)) is inefficient.

At each step, you calculate the area between the lines at st and en.

Since the shorter line limits the area, you move the pointer pointing 
to the shorter line hoping to find a taller one.

You continue until both pointers meet.

This ensures an optimal and efficient O(n) time solution.  */
