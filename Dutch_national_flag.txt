Dutch National Flag Algorithm (Made Simple)

🧠 What is it?

• Imagine you have a basket filled with red, white, and blue balls all mixed up. 
  You want to sort them so all reds come first, then whites, then blues — like the Dutch flag.

• In programming, we represent them as:
    Red → 0
    White → 1
    Blue → 2

>The goal is to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in one pass, without using extra space.

📌 When do we use this?
⇒ When you're given an array with only three types of values, and you want to sort them quickly and in-place.

🧩 How does it work?
⇒ We use three pointers to divide the array into sections:

    low  → where 0s should go
    mid  → the current number we're checking
    high → where 2s should go
We go through the array from left to right using the mid pointer, and depending on what we find:

🔁 Rules:
Value at mid	Action
     0	        Swap it with low, move both low and mid forward
     1	        It’s in the right place, just move mid
     2	        Swap it with high, move high backward (don’t move mid yet)
     
This keeps pushing 0s to the left, 2s to the right, and leaves 1s in the middle.

✍️ Let's see an example:
    nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
            0  1  2  3  4  5
∎Initial positions:
    low = 0 (index)
    mid = 0 (index)
    high = 5 (index)

∎Step-by-step dry run:
   Step	     nums	           low  mid	high	Action
    1	[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]	    0	0	5	    2 → swap with nums[high]
    2	[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]	    0	0	4	    0 → swap with nums[low]
    3	[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]	    1	1	4	    0 → swap with nums[low]
    4	[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]	    2	2	4	    2 → swap with nums[high]
    5	[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]	    2	2	3	    1 → move mid forward
    6	[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]	    2	3	3	    1 → move mid forward
    7	mid = 4 > high = 3				        Done!

■Final result:
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]


✅ Key points to remember:
   > This sorts the array in one pass → 🕒 O(n) time
   > No extra space → 💾 O(1) space
   > Only works when the array has three types of values
   > Think of it like pushing 0s to the left, 2s to the right, and leaving 1s in place

🧠 How to remember it:
"0s to the left, 2s to the right, 1s just stay."

If you ever forget how it works, just think of sorting red-white-blue balls into flag order, 
and this three-pointer trick will come back to you.
